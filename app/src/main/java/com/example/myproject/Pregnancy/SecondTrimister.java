            "What To Expect:\n\n\n" +
                    "Changes in Your Body:\n\n" +
                    "Pregnancy is different for every woman. Some women glow with good health and vitality " +
                    "during those first three months; others feel absolutely miserable. Here are some of the " +
                    "changes you might experience, what they mean, and which signs warrant a call to your doctor.\n\n\n",

            "Backache\n\n\n" +
                    "The extra weight you've gained in the last few months is starting to put pressure on your back, " +
                    "making it achy and sore. To ease the pressure, sit up straight and use a chair that provides " +
                    "good back support. Sleep on your side with a pillow tucked between your legs. Avoid picking up " +
                    "or carrying anything heavy. Wear low-heeled, comfortable shoes with good arch support. If the pain " +
                    "is really uncomfortable, ask your partner to rub the sore spots, or treat yourself to a pregnancy massage.\n\n\n",

            "Bleeding Gums\n\n\n" +
                    "About half of pregnant women develop swollen, tender gums. Hormone changes are sending more " +
                    "blood to your gums, making them more sensitive and causing them to bleed more easily. Your gums " +
                    "should go back to normal after your baby is born. In the meantime, use a softer toothbrush and be " +
                    "gentle when you floss, but don't skimp on dental hygiene. Studies show that pregnant women with gum " +
                    "disease (periodontal disease) may be more likely to go into premature labor and deliver a low-birthweight baby.\n\n\n",

            "Breast Enlargement\n\n\n" +
                    "Much of the breast tenderness you experienced during the first trimester should be wearing off, " +
                    "but your breasts are still growing as they prepare to feed your baby. Going up a bra size (or more) " +
                    "and wearing a good support bra can make you feel more comfortable.\n\n\n",

            "Frequent Urination\n\n\n" +
                    "Your uterus will rise away from the pelvic cavity during the second trimester, giving you a brief break " +
                    "from having to keep going to the bathroom. Don't get too comfortable, though. The urge to go will come " +
                    "back during the last trimester of your pregnancy.\n\n\n",

            "Hair Growth\n\n\n" +
                    "Pregnancy hormones can boost hair growth and not always where you want it. The hair on your head " +
                    "will become thicker. You may also be seeing hair in places you never had it before, including your " +
                    "face, arms, and back. Shaving and tweezing might not be the easiest options, but they're probably your " +
                    "safest bets right now. Many experts don't recommend laser hair removal, electrolysis, waxing, or " +
                    "depilatories during pregnancy, because research still hasn't proven that they are safe for the baby. " +
                    "Check to see what your doctor recommends.\n\n\n",

            "Headache\n\n\n" +
                    "Headaches are one of the most common pregnancy complaints. Try to get plenty of rest, and practice " +
                    "relaxation techniques, such as deep breathing. Aspirin and ibuprofen shouldnâ€™t be taken during " +
                    "pregnancy, but your doctor may say it's OK for you to take acetaminophen if you're really uncomfortable.\n\n\n",

            "Hemorrhoids\n\n\n" +
                    "Hemorrhoids are actually varicose veins swollen blue or purple veins that form around the anus. " +
                    "These veins may enlarge during pregnancy, because extra blood is flowing through them and there is " +
                    "increased pressure on them from the growing uterus. Varicose veins can be itchy and uncomfortable. To " +
                    "relieve them, try sitting in a warm tub or sitz bath. Ask your doctor whether you can use an over-the-counter " +
                    "hemorrhoid ointment.\n\n\n",

            "Skin Changes\n\n\n" +
                    "Pregnant women often look as though they are glowing because changing hormone levels make " +
                    "the skin on the face appear flushed. An increase in the pigment melanin can also lead to brown marks " +
                    "on the face (often called the mask of pregnancy) and a dark line (linea nigra) down the middle of " +
                    "the abdomen. All of these skin changes should fade after the baby is born. In the meantime, " +
                    "you can use makeup to conceal them.\n\n\n"
